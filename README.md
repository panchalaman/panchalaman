### Data Engineer | Background in AI & Data Science

I'm 23, and I build data pipelines. I came from AI and Data Science, but I realized pretty quickly that the best model in the world is useless if the data feeding it is unreliable. So I moved to the infrastructure side — designing warehouses, writing ETL pipelines, and making sure the data actually gets where it needs to go, correctly.

This GitHub is where I learn in public. Every project here was written by hand, debugged in the terminal, and documented like I'd want to read it myself.

### Projects I've Built

These aren't hypothetical — every one of these has working code, documented SQL, and a README that explains the why, not just the what.

| Project | What I did | Key techniques |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**Job Market EDA**](https://github.com/panchalaman/Data-Engineering-Journey/tree/main/Data-Engineering/SQL_COURSE/Projects/1_EDA) | Wrote 3 analytical queries to find which skills are most in-demand, which pay the best, and which give the best return on investment. Built a custom scoring formula using `LN()` to balance demand against salary. | Multi-table JOINs, MEDIAN, HAVING, LN() transformation, composite scoring |
| [**Data Warehouse & Mart Build**](https://github.com/panchalaman/Data-Engineering-Journey/tree/main/Data-Engineering/SQL_COURSE/Projects/2_WH_Mart_Build) | Full ETL pipeline — extract CSVs from Google Cloud Storage, load into a star schema, then build 4 specialized data marts (flat, skills demand, priority roles, company hiring). Incremental updates with MERGE. | Star schema, GCS extraction, MERGE upsert, additive measures, bridge tables, schema separation |
| [**Flat CSV to Star Schema**](https://github.com/panchalaman/Data-Engineering-Journey/tree/main/Data-Engineering/SQL_COURSE/Projects/3_Flat_to_WH_Build) | Took a genuinely messy CSV (skills stored as Python list strings like `['SQL', 'Python']`) and transformed it into a normalized star schema. Self-directed project, not from any course. | String parsing (REPLACE/SPLIT/UNNEST), surrogate keys, bridge tables, FK constraints |
| [**Priority Jobs Pipeline**](https://github.com/panchalaman/Data-Engineering-Journey/tree/main/Data-Engineering/SQL_COURSE/Projects/4_Priority_Jobs_Pipeline) | Incremental ETL pipeline that tracks job postings by role priority. Built both the manual UPDATE+INSERT approach and a single-statement MERGE for comparison. | DDL/DML, staging tables, upsert patterns, MERGE INTO, schema evolution, IS DISTINCT FROM |

### Learning Resources I've Written

| Resource | What's in it |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**SQL Course**](https://github.com/panchalaman/Data-Engineering-Journey/tree/main/Data-Engineering/SQL_COURSE/Lessons) | 15 lessons from zero to data-engineer-ready SQL — JOINs, window functions, CTEs, star schema design, ETL patterns, query optimization. All runnable in DuckDB. |
| [**Docker for Data Engineering**](https://github.com/panchalaman/Data-Engineering-Journey/tree/main/Learn%20Docker) | 15 lessons covering containers, images, Compose, networking, volumes, databases, Airflow, CI/CD, security. Includes 3 hands-on projects and a command reference. |
| [**Linux & Git Fundamentals**](https://github.com/panchalaman/Data-Engineering-Journey/tree/main/Learn%20Linux) | File operations, grep/awk/sed, piping, permissions, shell scripting, and Git version control. |

### Get in Touch

I'm looking for data engineering roles where I can build pipelines, design warehouses, and work with people who care about data quality.
